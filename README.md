This ia a PDF version of the RS232 Then and Now presentation at VCF SW 2025.
The "A" version is a Print to PDF version, while the regular file is a "Save As" version.  
Content-wise shouldn't be any difference.

Also available is the original PowerPoint version, with the original images and foot notes.

Past the "end" slide there are many more slides I ended up having to cut from the presentation
due to time constraints.    At the very end is several pages of links and references that I
used in verifying and preparing content.
